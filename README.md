Project 2

Create a program for CPU scheduling algorithms.
 FCFS Scheduling algorithm
 SJF Scheduling algorithm
 Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling algorithm  RR Scheduling algorithm
Input: two-dimensional array (Process ID, Burst time, Priority) Output: display the turnaround time for all processes.

The program compiles and runs as assigned. The welcome message will promopt the user for the number of processes, the process IDs, process burst time, and process priority, then will prompt the user for a scheduling algorithm selection using a case selection.  After collecting inputs, the program will display a table of the inputted process data for review.
